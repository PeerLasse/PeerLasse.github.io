        <h1>EAERE 2024: Exploring Temperature Sensitivity in Global Electricity Demand</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published on July 5, 2024, by Peer Hinrichsen</p>
        <section class="post-content">
          <p>From July 1 to July 4, 2024, the 29th Annual Conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE) took place in Leuven, Belgium. This prestigious event brought together leading researchers in environmental and resource economics to discuss emerging challenges and innovative solutions.</p>
          <p>During the conference, I had the opportunity to present my latest research titled <strong>"Temperature Sensitivity of Residential Electricity Demand on the Global Scale: A Bayesian Partial Pooling Model."</strong> This project is a collaborative effort with <strong>Katrin Rhedanz</strong> and <strong>Richard S.J. Tol</strong>, in which we explore how temperature variations influence electricity consumption patterns worldwide.</p>
          <p>Our study employs a Bayesian partial pooling model to capture regional heterogeneity in electricity demand responses. The findings provide valuable insights into climate adaptation strategies and energy policy, particularly in the context of increasing global temperatures.</p>
          <p>Presenting our work at EAERE 2024 was an excellent opportunity to engage with fellow researchers and policymakers. The discussions that followed emphasized the importance of incorporating statistical rigor and interdisciplinary collaboration to address climate-related energy challenges.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we aim to refine our model by incorporating additional socioeconomic factors and expanding our dataset. We welcome further collaboration and discussions on this topicâ€”feel free to reach out if you're interested!</p>

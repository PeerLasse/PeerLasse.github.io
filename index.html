    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Professional Headshot" class="profile-img">
    <p>Hello, I am <strong>Peer</strong>, a researcher specializing in energy and environmental economics. I am a Junior Researcher and Doctoral Candidate at the CAU-Kiel Institute of Environmental, Resource, and Spatial Economics, where I leverage advanced econometric methodsâ€”such as Bayesian multilevel modelsâ€”to analyze the relationship between energy demand and climate change. My research relies on large-scale datasets and cutting-edge statistical techniques to generate actionable insights in the field of energy and environmental economics.

With a MSc in Quantitative Economics, I have a strong foundation in statistics, econometrics, and data science. My expertise includes working extensively with R for statistical analysis, data preparation, and visualization in research projects. Additionally, my background in Computer Science (minor) introduced me to Python programming, algorithmic thinking, and relational databases (SQL)â€”further strengthening my technical skill set.

As a research assistant, I developed expertise in data acquisition, transformation, and management, handling large datasets from diverse sources and preparing them for empirical research. This role also required working with QGIS for spatial data processing and visualization, allowing me to integrate geographic insights into economic analyses. These experiences sharpened my ability to independently acquire, synthesize, and apply new domain knowledge, particularly in the intersection of spatial analysis and econometric modeling

My academic training provides a strong economic core, equipping me with a deep understanding of macroeconomic and microeconomic processes. Having pursued my studies entirely in English, I am well-prepared to contribute to international research collaborations and global policy discussions in the field of energy and environmental economics.

Key Skills & Expertise
ðŸ”¹ Econometrics & Statistical Modeling (Bayesian Multilevel Models, Time-Series, Panel Data)
ðŸ”¹ Programming & Data Science (R, Python, SQL)
ðŸ”¹ Energy & Environmental Economics (Climate Impact on Energy Demand)
ðŸ”¹ Big Data Analysis & Management (Large Datasets, Data Wrangling, Visualization)
ðŸ”¹ Academic Research & Policy Analysis (Publishing, Scientific Writing, Knowledge Transfer)
ðŸ”¹ International Collaboration & Communication (Research Networking, English Fluency)

I am always open to collaborations, research opportunities, and industry-academic partnerships in energy economics, climate policy, and statistical modeling. Feel free to connect or reach out if our interests align!</p>
